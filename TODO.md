# Underwater Fish Adventure - Implementation Checklist

## Core Setup
- [x] Create app layout with proper Next.js routing
- [x] Set up main game page component
- [x] Implement Canvas-based game renderer

## Game Engine
- [x] Build core game loop with requestAnimationFrame
- [x] Implement state management (Menu → Playing → Paused → GameOver)
- [x] Create input system for keyboard and touch controls
- [x] Build physics engine with gravity and collision detection

## Game Components
- [x] Create Player (Dino) with sprite animations and physics
- [x] Implement obstacle system (cacti and birds)
- [x] Build scrolling ground and environment system
- [x] Add HUD with score display and game over screen

## Audio & Polish
- [x] Implement audio system with sound effects
- [x] Add visual effects and animations
- [x] Ensure responsive design for mobile and desktop
- [x] Optimize performance for 60fps gameplay

## Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Testing & Deployment
- [x] Test gameplay mechanics and controls
- [x] Verify responsive behavior across devices
- [x] Build and start production server
- [x] Final testing and optimization
